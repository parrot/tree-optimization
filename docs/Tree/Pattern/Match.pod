=head1 NAME

Tree::Pattern::Match - the result object from matching a Tree::Pattern

=head1  DESCRIPTION

Tree::Pattern::Match objects are returned by matching operations on
L<Tree::Pattern> objects.

It can be used to determine whether the match was successful, find the
matching node, and to find the match results of subpatterns.

=item success([value])

This attribute is true if the match was successful and false otherwise.

=item orig([value])

This attribute holds the original matching node if there is one.

It is not present for matches with the C<global> or C<g> options if more than
one match was found.

It is meaningless for an unsuccessful match.

=item ast()

This attribute, like the ast attribute of regex match results, holds an
abstract object that has been associated with the match result with the
"!make" method or the NQP-rx make statement.
